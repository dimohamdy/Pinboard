# Pinboard
This app fetches Json data from this url http://pastebin.com/raw/wgkJgazE and displays user name and image in a table view

Patterns used in this app are Observer pattern with a slight change, MVVM pattern for preparing the data that will be displayed in the table view controller.

## Further impovements
- I could use a collection view displaying the pins in two columns with images sizes different.
- Some clean up is needed moving some code out of the table view controller
